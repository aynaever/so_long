1- Check the map if it is valid or not.(done)
	a- The map must be composed of only 5 possible characters: 0 for an empty space, 1 for a wall, C for a collectible, E for map exit and P for the player’s starting position. (done)
	b- The map must be closed/surrounded by walls, if not the program must return an error. (done)
	c- Map must have at least one exit, one collectible, and one starting position. (done)
	d- The map must be rectangular.(done)
	e- If any misconfiguration of any kind is encountered in the file, the program must exit properly and return "Error\n" followed by an explicit error message of your choice.(done)

2- Draw the map:(done)
	a- Draw walls.(done)
	b- Draw floor.(done)
	c- Draw exit.(done)
	d- Draw collectibles.(done)
	e- Draw player.(done)

3- Code functionality:
	a- The W, A, S, and D keys will be used to move the main character.
	b- Pressing ESC must close the window and quit the program cleanly.
	c- Clicking on the red cross on the window’s frame must close the window and quit the program cleanly.
	d- player cannot move into walls.
	e- The player’s goal is to collect all collectibles present on the map then escape with minimal movement.

4- Test it:


####################### Check map #######################

1- check_line(int is_middle, char *line) : this function returns 1 if the line is valid and 0 if it's not, if the line is in the middle then it just checks the first and last character if it is 1 or not, and if the line is not in the middle it checks if all of the charactres are 1.

2- check_valid_chars(char *line) : this function checks if the line has other characters than '0', '1', 'C', 'E', 'P', it returns 0 if it found other then those characters and 1 if only it found those characters.

3- if the length of a line differs then the length of the first line, then it's not a valid map. (done)

4- if the length of the first line equals to the number of lines then, then it's not a valid map. (done)

I forget that the line has the new line character at the end and it's calculated in the length, that's what caused me many problems.
